    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data. You‚Äôll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won‚Äôt have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use pivot tables.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots and deal with any interactive elements, this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

    <p>Yes, you can scrape data without using code -- in fact, all you need is Google Sheets! We'll be using Excel-type formulas (don't worry if you don't know what those are, either) to make simple scrapers that automatically pull data into Google Sheets. It‚Äôs the best way to get around clunky websites and unhelpful PIOs!</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners who want to start using data for their stories.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Open data provides unique insights into crime, policing and criminal justice activity within a city and creates a new opportunity to tell complex, interactive stories in dashboard format. These data are a terrific source for identifying changing crime trends, evaluating policy effectiveness, and providing transparency to the public on issues of critical importance. In this presentation Jeff Asher of AH Datalytics will go over the different types of available data throughout the criminal justice spectrum and give examples of how these data can be used both in terms of analyzing crime trends as well as building dashboards to better illustrate a story.</p>

    <p>So often the most celebrated examples of innovation in digital, visual and interactive journalism come from teams with uncommon access to resources and talent. You know the ones, often on the coasts, that continually set the industry standard for digital innovation.</p><p>This panel isn't about those newsrooms. Instead, it will showcase the creative digital storytelling happening in local and regional newsrooms, where time and resources are scarce. The panel will be framed as a series of short talks and examples and will include an ability for journalists who cannot attend NICAR to present their work as well.</p>

    <p>Census 2020 has already begun, and it's already creating data ‚Äî and stories. This session, anchored to the timeline of the coming year, will get you up to speed: key dates, lingo and what stories are possible when. We'll also offer a compendium of Census 2010 stories and local data like 2010 response and undercount rates. You'll also get a clear explanation of the unprecedented plan to add statistical noise to most Census 2020 results, and how that will affect your stories. Also: Late updates on the plan to use the census to bootstrap a controversial new data set: a count of citizens and non-citizens in every neighborhood.</p>

    <p>Many factors come into play when considering the security of a story. The most notable is the security around conversations with sources. While this is important, this is not the only point in the process to consider the security of your interactions and information. In this training, we will overview the different types of encryption and how it comes into play when researching, writing, and communicating new stories. Attendees will walk away from this training understanding how to make informed decisions about the security of their tools and process from research to publication of a story.</p>

    <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well ‚Äî or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

    <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first-time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is affecting communities is vital, and this panel would show attendees how to do it. </p><p>This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project. We'll discuss data they should be requesting from their local agencies for quick turn stories or to find trends, including from housing courts, public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data-driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Python has been considered the go-to for scraping websites. But did you know it's really easy to do in R? Using the R library rvest, and a tool called "Selector Gadget" that lets you select elements by clicking, I hacked my way into scraping after multiple attempts in learning scraping the traditional way (BeautifulSoup and Inspect element). One of the advantages of R is that you can do everything in one environment, so why not include scraping into your R workflow?  </p><p>This session is good for: R users looking for another tool or coding beginners struggling to learn scraping in Python.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>We all love making political graphics, and election night can be a fun exercise in showing off our data graphics prowess. But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data? Is there any way to contextualize our graphics so we stop explaining WHO has power, but instead focus on HOW that power is used FOR or AGAINST who?</p><p>In the lead-up to 2020, let‚Äôs thoughtfully discuss why we do election results graphics and how can we make it better so that we can move beyond the ‚Äúhorserace‚Äù aspect of data journalism.</p>

    <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Data journalism encompasses many different kinds of work, whether you work full time with data, manage a data team, use data to cover a beat, or use data visualization and interactivity to tell visual stories. It's not always clear what professional options may be available, or how you might go about growing into new opportunities. </p><p>In this session, we'll hear from a newspaper reporter whose focus on data eventually took them into academia, a designer/developer/journalist who ended up moving into leadership to help bring together her newsroom's visual storytelling departments, as well as a veteran TV journalist who forged her own path when there wasn't a data job in the newsroom.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>In recent years, a handful of news organizations have published diversity reports to educate people in the industry about their challenges with diversity and to indicate that they are taking newsroom diversity seriously. This has also led to conversations about the effectiveness of diversity reports, what they should cover and how we can convince management to publish more revelatory indicators of diversity.</p><p>This will be a working session around all these questions. We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.</p>

What techniques help them get the point across? Are p-value statements even necessary?

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Satellite imagery has become easier to obtain, process and analyze, and journalists have increasingly turned to pictures from space to show burned land, eroding coastline and storm-ravaged landscapes. But there‚Äôs data in those pixels that journalists might not have considered that can be used to tell stories about the world around them ‚Äî ethnic cleansing, tribal clashes, the health of forests, pollution and more. </p><p>We turn to a panel of leading geospatial experts to explain how we could use remote sensing methods and tools like Google Earth Engine to lend authority to stories that otherwise might rely on anecdotes or worse yet, never get told at all.</p>

    <p>Voter file data can be an important reporting tool, but the data is so fragmented it's difficult to find, standardize and aggregate. In addition, readers are often shocked that this level of data is available. We will discuss practical tips for when voter data is useful, how to find and process it, what it can't do, and how to report accurately and responsibly on voter data breaches, and leave lots of time for voter data questions!</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Visualization is often taught as a set of rules that are set in stone ‚Äî "pie charts are dumb!", "make all your graphs start at 0!", "increase data-ink ratio!" ‚Äî but what if those rules have shaky foundations, being based just on the very personal aesthetic preferences of a handful of influential authors? This talk suggests that visualization is more similar to writing that we think: It's constrained by the limitations of the human brain but, beyond that, it's as flexible as written language, if not more. Instead of thinking of rules, then, visualization designers should learn how to make justified and informed decisions instead.</p>

    <p>It's always been tricky to make data findings come to life on radio. Radio producers appreciate the role of data in investigative findings, but often producers and data reporters have to come up with creative and innovative solutions. This session will take the audience through some successful award-winning examples and unpack the different kinds of datasets that can lend themselves to the different strategies whether it is programmatic data sonification, creative use of narration or using a live church choir.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data. You‚Äôll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won‚Äôt have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use pivot tables.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots and deal with any interactive elements, this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Open data provides unique insights into crime, policing and criminal justice activity within a city and creates a new opportunity to tell complex, interactive stories in dashboard format. These data are a terrific source for identifying changing crime trends, evaluating policy effectiveness, and providing transparency to the public on issues of critical importance. In this presentation Jeff Asher of AH Datalytics will go over the different types of available data throughout the criminal justice spectrum and give examples of how these data can be used both in terms of analyzing crime trends as well as building dashboards to better illustrate a story.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>This class will cover basic approaches for getting text out of PDF documents using online tool Cometdocs. IRE members have free subscriptions, which means no limit to the number of documents to convert. (No attendance is necessary, just email cometdocs@ire.org). For extracting tables, you'll play with Tabula in a step-by-step demo. In addition, you'll learn how to use a text editor and the import feature in Excel if neither of these approaches work. Lastly, if time allows, you'll see a demo of PDFtk, used for merging, splitting, and rotating a large batch of PDFs. Note that we will not cover Optical Character Recognition as it will be addressed in PDF2.</p><p><br>This session is good for: Non-coders without access to Adobe Acrobat Pro/DC and people who are unfamiliar with PDF-to-text tools or would like to learn how these tools can be used for extracting difficult text from images embedded in a PDF document.</p>

Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first-time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is affecting communities is vital, and this panel would show attendees how to do it. </p><p>This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project. We'll discuss data they should be requesting from their local agencies for quick turn stories or to find trends, including from housing courts, public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data-driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Once the exclusive domain of scientists, engineers and HAM radio operators, a new generation of cheap hardware and open source software have cracked open the radio spectrum for hackers, hobbyists ‚Äî and journalists ‚Äî to explore. Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it‚Äôs time you started looking for them. We'll give an overview of how this all works, and walk you through the tools you can use to start poking around the radio spectrum. We‚Äôll also look at some interesting examples of how the radio spectrum has been used in reporting the news.</p>

    <p>Python has been considered the go-to for scraping websites. But did you know it's really easy to do in R? Using the R library rvest, and a tool called "Selector Gadget" that lets you select elements by clicking, I hacked my way into scraping after multiple attempts in learning scraping the traditional way (BeautifulSoup and Inspect element). One of the advantages of R is that you can do everything in one environment, so why not include scraping into your R workflow?  </p><p>This session is good for: R users looking for another tool or coding beginners struggling to learn scraping in Python.</p>

But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data?

    <p>Data journalism encompasses many different kinds of work, whether you work full time with data, manage a data team, use data to cover a beat, or use data visualization and interactivity to tell visual stories. It's not always clear what professional options may be available, or how you might go about growing into new opportunities. </p><p>In this session, we'll hear from a newspaper reporter whose focus on data eventually took them into academia, a designer/developer/journalist who ended up moving into leadership to help bring together her newsroom's visual storytelling departments, as well as a veteran TV journalist who forged her own path when there wasn't a data job in the newsroom.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>In recent years, a handful of news organizations have published diversity reports to educate people in the industry about their challenges with diversity and to indicate that they are taking newsroom diversity seriously. This has also led to conversations about the effectiveness of diversity reports, what they should cover and how we can convince management to publish more revelatory indicators of diversity.</p><p>This will be a working session around all these questions. We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Satellite imagery has become easier to obtain, process and analyze, and journalists have increasingly turned to pictures from space to show burned land, eroding coastline and storm-ravaged landscapes. But there‚Äôs data in those pixels that journalists might not have considered that can be used to tell stories about the world around them ‚Äî ethnic cleansing, tribal clashes, the health of forests, pollution and more. </p><p>We turn to a panel of leading geospatial experts to explain how we could use remote sensing methods and tools like Google Earth Engine to lend authority to stories that otherwise might rely on anecdotes or worse yet, never get told at all.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Satellites, planes, drones ‚Äî thanks to these and other planetary-sensors, we know more about our earth, its oceans, landscapes and cityscapes than ever before. With heaps of new data and tools at our disposal, journalists are among the many people accessing this wellspring of source data and using it to show changes at global and local scales at an ever-increasing rate, from the disappearing polar ice caps to monitoring local port shipments.</p><p>This workshop will provide an introduction to practical geographic journalism through concrete case studies. It will then offer tools and skills that can help you start infusing earth imagery into your stories. You will leave this workshop with a new way of thinking about earth imagery and how to use it.</p><p>Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites but it would be helpful to have some experience with QGIS, bash (imagemagick, ffmpeg, gdal), and Photoshop.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Visualization is often taught as a set of rules that are set in stone ‚Äî "pie charts are dumb!", "make all your graphs start at 0!", "increase data-ink ratio!" ‚Äî but what if those rules have shaky foundations, being based just on the very personal aesthetic preferences of a handful of influential authors? This talk suggests that visualization is more similar to writing that we think: It's constrained by the limitations of the human brain but, beyond that, it's as flexible as written language, if not more. Instead of thinking of rules, then, visualization designers should learn how to make justified and informed decisions instead.</p>

In this workshop, we‚Äôd go over common types of property records that are likely kept by your local, county, and state governments‚Äîincluding corporation filings that are useful for peeking behind pesky LLCs. We‚Äôll also point out a few common issues with this type of data (assessors and recorders usually don‚Äôt share data!), pose general solutions to them (both with and without knowledge of coding languages), and walk through a sample scraper.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>With the decennial census approaching, the Census Reporter team is thinking again about making tools to help journalists use Census data. We want to hear from journalists of all experience levels about what they want to do with Census data, especially decennial and American Community Survey. We don‚Äôt have funding right now, but we‚Äôre hoping that you all can help us paint an irresistible picture of a system that could be built, and use it to help build the support we need to make it happen. This will be a structured session designed to capture ‚Äústep,‚Äù ‚Äústretch,‚Äù and ‚Äúleap‚Äù improvements to the experience of finding and making sense of Census data.</p>
