                <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data. You‚Äôll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won‚Äôt have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use pivot tables.</p>

                <p>Fuzzy matching is a process for linking up names that are similar but not quite the same. It has become an increasingly important part of data-led investigations as a way to identify connections between public figures, key people and companies that are relevant to a story. This class will cover how fuzzy matching typically fits into the investigative process, with some story examples. </p><p>Max Harlow, who developed the CSV Match command line tool, will show you how to run some of the different types of fuzzy matching on some real datasets, including the pros and cons of each.</p><p>This session is good for: People who feel comfortable using the command line.</p>

                <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots, and deal with any interactive elements this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

                <p>Statistical methods can help you go beyond counting, sorting and filtering data to look at relationships, make predictions and level the playing fields. Statistical analyses can provide hard evidence to back up (or discredit) a theory. This master class will help you understand the concepts and methods most often used by journalists, including:</p><p>* Linear regression<br>* Correlation<br>* Statistical significance<br>* Describing and visualizing your data</p><p>This master class is aimed at those already familiar with basic data analysis using spreadsheets and ready to add statistical analysis to their toolkits. </p><p>Please bring your laptop to the training. Before the conference, please install R and R Studio (free, open-source software) on your computers.</p>

                <p>So often the most celebrated examples of innovation in digital, visual and interactive journalism come from teams with uncommon access to resources and talent. You know the ones, often on the coasts, that continually set the industry standard for digital innovation.</p><p>This panel isn't about those newsrooms. Instead, it will showcase the creative digital storytelling happening in local and regional newsrooms, where time and resources are scarce. The panel will be framed as a series of short talks and examples and will include an ability for journalists who cannot attend NICAR to present their work as well.</p>

                <p>This class will cover basic approaches for getting text out of PDF documents using online tool Cometdocs. IRE members have free subscriptions, which means no limit to the number of documents to convert. (No attendance is necessary, just email cometdocs@ire.org). For extracting tables, you'll play with Tabula in a step-by-step demo. In addition, you'll learn how to use a text editor and the import feature in Excel if neither of these approaches work. Lastly, if time allows, you'll see a demo of PDFtk, used for merging, splitting, and rotating a large batch of PDFs. Note that we will not cover Optical Character Recognition as it will be addressed in PDF2.</p><p><br>This session is good for: Non-coders without access to Adobe Acrobat Pro/DC and people who are unfamiliar with PDF-to-text tools or would like to learn how these tools can be used for extracting difficult text from images embedded in a PDF document.</p>

                <p>Census 2020 has already begun, and it's already creating data ‚Äî and stories. This session, anchored to the timeline of the coming year, will get you up to speed: key dates, lingo and what stories are possible when. We'll also offer a compendium of Census 2010 stories and local data like 2010 response and undercount rates. You'll also get a clear explanation of the unprecedented plan to add statistical noise to most Census 2020 results, and how that will affect your stories. Also: Late updates on the plan to use the census to bootstrap a controversial new data set: a count of citizens and non-citizens in every neighborhood.</p>

                <p>Many factors come into play when considering the security of a story. The most notable is the security around conversations with sources. While this is important, this is not the only point in the process to consider the security of your interactions and information. In this training, we will overview the different types of encryption and how it comes into play when researching, writing, and communicating new stories. Attendees will walk away from this training understanding how to make informed decisions about the security of their tools and process from research to publication of a story.</p>

                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well ‚Äî or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>Python has been considered the go-to for scraping websites. But did you know it's really easy to do in R? Using the R library rvest, and a tool called "Selector Gadget" that lets you select elements by clicking, I hacked my way into scraping after multiple attempts in learning scraping the traditional way (BeautifulSoup and Inspect element). One of the advantages of R is that you can do everything in one environment, so why not include scraping into your R workflow?  </p><p>This session is good for: R users looking for another tool or coding beginners struggling to learn scraping in Python.</p>

                <p>We all love making political graphics, and election night can be a fun exercise in showing off our data graphics prowess. But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data? Is there any way to contextualize our graphics so we stop explaining WHO has power, but instead focus on HOW that power is used FOR or AGAINST who?</p><p>In the lead-up to 2020, let‚Äôs thoughtfully discuss why we do election results graphics and how can we make it better so that we can move beyond the ‚Äúhorserace‚Äù aspect of data journalism.</p>

Many of the same steps you take in preparing for and conducting a human interview can be applied to your data work. Beyond that, the framework will help you navigate common issues with data that you need to find and deal with before you even start your analysis.</p>

                <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.</p>

                <p>Data journalism encompasses many different kinds of work, whether you work full time with data, manage a data team, use data to cover a beat, or use data visualization and interactivity to tell visual stories. It's not always clear what professional options may be available, or how you might go about growing into new opportunities. </p><p>In this session, we'll hear from a newspaper reporter whose focus on data eventually took them into academia, a designer/developer/journalist who ended up moving into leadership to help bring together her newsroom's visual storytelling departments, as well as a veteran TV journalist who forged her own path when there wasn't a data job in the newsroom.</p>

                <p>Linear regression helps you find relationships between two or more variables, but when an outcome has only two possibilities, you need a different tool. That, my friends, is where logistic regression comes in. This class will be taught in R.</p><p>This session is good for: People who took "Stats: An introduction" or are comfortable with summary statistics and spreadsheets. Experience with R is recommended.</p>

                <p>Bring your data to life with elegant and intelligent visualizations with the D3 JavaScript library. We'll start with some Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) basics and learn what makes the D3 library so powerful, then use real-world datasets to build your first D3 chart. We will build on D3 basics by exploring more complex chart forms, covering functions for fetching and manipulating data, and introducing transitions and interaction. We will write working code together, break down how some of our favorite examples of D3 charts work and practice reading documentation so you can gain expertise on your own.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: Attendees should have some knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Previous D3 experience is not required.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúWho owns what‚Äù is a classic reporting problem with a broad range of applications, whether you‚Äôre breaking news or during investigative work. In this workshop, we‚Äôd go over common types of property records that are likely kept by your local, county, and state governments‚Äîincluding corporation filings that are useful for peeking behind pesky LLCs. We‚Äôll also point out a few common issues with this type of data (assessors and recorders usually don‚Äôt share data!), pose general solutions to them (both with and without knowledge of coding languages), and walk through a sample scraper.</p>

                <p>With the decennial census approaching, the Census Reporter team is thinking again about making tools to help journalists use Census data. We want to hear from journalists of all experience levels about what they want to do with Census data, especially decennial and American Community Survey. We don‚Äôt have funding right now, but we‚Äôre hoping that you all can help us paint an irresistible picture of a system that could be built, and use it to help build the support we need to make it happen. This will be a structured session designed to capture ‚Äústep,‚Äù ‚Äústretch,‚Äù and ‚Äúleap‚Äù improvements to the experience of finding and making sense of Census data.</p>

                <p>Numbers, numbers, numbers. Many journalists and journalism educators run from numbers and data because the words are scary without an understanding of real-world applications. Some, such as Loyola University, have had success making data come alive for their students by partnering with InvestigateTV on projects so students can relate to the numbers and see how data is used professionally. </p><p>Panelists will discuss their projects and give ideas for finding partners so you can do the same whether you are a student, an educator looking to enhance classroom learning or a professional eager for data help.</p>

                <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data. You‚Äôll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won‚Äôt have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited.

                <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots, and deal with any interactive elements this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

                <p>Yes, you can scrape data without using code -- in fact, all you need is Google Sheets! We'll be using Excel-type formulas (don't worry if you don't know what those are, either) to make simple scrapers that automatically pull data into Google Sheets. It‚Äôs the best way to get around clunky websites and unhelpful PIOs!</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners who want to start using data for their stories.</p>

                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>Alex Garcia, Iris Lee, Ben Welsh and Aaron Williams teach you how to rapidly prototype a complex data visualization with JavaScript, D3.js and an interactive Observable notebook.</p><p>This three-hour, hands-on course will show you how journalists are putting Observable‚Äôs powerful potential to work. Using nothing but your web browser, you will sketch, refine and publish an interactive graphic like one that appeared in The New York Times. Along the way, you‚Äôll see how Observable‚Äôs groundbreaking approach to coding can help you be more creative, ambitious and efficient.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: If you‚Äôve used JavaScript once or twice, have a good attitude and know how to take a few code crashes in stride, you are qualified for this class. If you‚Äôre suspicious and think we might be Internet hipsters, we welcome the challenge of winning you over. This stuff is cool.</p>

                <p>Statistical methods can help you go beyond counting, sorting and filtering data to look at relationships, make predictions and level the playing fields. Statistical analyses can provide hard evidence to back up (or discredit) a theory. This master class will help you understand the concepts and methods most often used by journalists, including:</p><p>* Linear regression<br>* Correlation<br>* Statistical significance<br>* Describing and visualizing your data</p><p>This master class is aimed at those already familiar with basic data analysis using spreadsheets and ready to add statistical analysis to their toolkits. </p><p>Please bring your laptop to the training. Before the conference, please install R and R Studio (free, open-source software) on your computers.</p>

                <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.</p>

                <p>This class will cover basic approaches for getting text out of PDF documents using online tool Cometdocs. IRE members have free subscriptions, which means no limit to the number of documents to convert. (No attendance is necessary, just email cometdocs@ire.org). For extracting tables, you'll play with Tabula in a step-by-step demo. In addition, you'll learn how to use a text editor and the import feature in Excel if neither of these approaches work. Lastly, if time allows, you'll see a demo of PDFtk, used for merging, splitting, and rotating a large batch of PDFs. Note that we will not cover Optical Character Recognition as it will be addressed in PDF2.</p><p><br>This session is good for: Non-coders without access to Adobe Acrobat Pro/DC and people who are unfamiliar with PDF-to-text tools or would like to learn how these tools can be used for extracting difficult text from images embedded in a PDF document.</p>

                <p>Census 2020 has already begun, and it's already creating data ‚Äî and stories. This session, anchored to the timeline of the coming year, will get you up to speed: key dates, lingo and what stories are possible when. We'll also offer a compendium of Census 2010 stories and local data like 2010 response and undercount rates. You'll also get a clear explanation of the unprecedented plan to add statistical noise to most Census 2020 results, and how that will affect your stories. Also: Late updates on the plan to use the census to bootstrap a controversial new data set: a count of citizens and non-citizens in every neighborhood.</p>

                <p>Many factors come into play when considering the security of a story. The most notable is the security around conversations with sources. While this is important, this is not the only point in the process to consider the security of your interactions and information. In this training, we will overview the different types of encryption and how it comes into play when researching, writing, and communicating new stories. Attendees will walk away from this training understanding how to make informed decisions about the security of their tools and process from research to publication of a story.</p>

                <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well ‚Äî or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

                <p>Python has been considered the go-to for scraping websites. But did you know it's really easy to do in R? Using the R library rvest, and a tool called "Selector Gadget" that lets you select elements by clicking, I hacked my way into scraping after multiple attempts in learning scraping the traditional way (BeautifulSoup and Inspect element). One of the advantages of R is that you can do everything in one environment, so why not include scraping into your R workflow?  </p><p>This session is good for: R users looking for another tool or coding beginners struggling to learn scraping in Python.</p>

                <p>We all love making political graphics, and election night can be a fun exercise in showing off our data graphics prowess. But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data?

                <p>You‚Äôve learned how to use formulas and make pivot tables in Excel or maybe you've dabbled in a SQL program or R, but too often when you sit down in front of your own data, you find yourself staring at the computer screen, unsure how to proceed. </p><p>This session will give you a framework for a process you can follow with every new dataset you work with and set you up with some best practices that will make you more efficient and less likely to make a mistake, regardless of what tool you are using for your analysis. </p><p>At the heart of this framework is the idea that you are ‚Äúinterviewing‚Äù data in much the same way you would a human source. Many of the same steps you take in preparing for and conducting a human interview can be applied to your data work. Beyond that, the framework will help you navigate common issues with data that you need to find and deal with before you even start your analysis.</p>

                <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints.

Her deep analysis of years of North Carolina court records showed that fewer than 1 in 4 people charged with sexual assault are ever convicted of that or a lesser crime.

                <p>Data journalism encompasses many different kinds of work, whether you work full time with data, manage a data team, use data to cover a beat, or use data visualization and interactivity to tell visual stories. It's not always clear what professional options may be available, or how you might go about growing into new opportunities. </p><p>In this session, we'll hear from a newspaper reporter whose focus on data eventually took them into academia, a designer/developer/journalist who ended up moving into leadership to help bring together her newsroom's visual storytelling departments, as well as a veteran TV journalist who forged her own path when there wasn't a data job in the newsroom.</p>

                <p>Statisticians need to really understand their data (and so do you!) before they begin running analyses. As a result, stats software like RStudio has many powerful tools to summarize your data. You're going to love them. We'll take a look at the structure of data in RStudio, do data transformations and run some basic statistical tests.</p><p>This session is good for: People who have familiarity with Excel and some database software.

                <p>Satellites, planes, drones ‚Äî thanks to these and other planetary-sensors, we know more about our earth, its oceans, landscapes and cityscapes than ever before. With heaps of new data and tools at our disposal, journalists are among the many people accessing this wellspring of source data and using it to show changes at global and local scales at an ever-increasing rate, from the disappearing polar ice caps to monitoring local port shipments.</p><p>This workshop will provide an introduction to practical geographic journalism through concrete case studies. It will then offer tools and skills that can help you start infusing earth imagery into your stories. You will leave this workshop with a new way of thinking about earth imagery and how to use it.</p><p>Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites but it would be helpful to have some experience with QGIS, bash (imagemagick, ffmpeg, gdal), and Photoshop.</p>

                <p>As data journalists, we're used to using relational databases ‚Äî data organised in rows and columns such as a spreadsheet or SQL ‚Äî to do our analysis and find stories. Graph databases are incredibly powerful for finding connections and patterns within our databases that would be difficult if not impossible to spot using traditional software. </p><p>This session will provide a hands-on introduction to graph database Neo4j, showing examples of its use for investigative journalism including the Panama Papers, and teach you how to build your own graph database, importing public datasets to see at a glance the networks involved.</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners to graph databases.</p>

In this workshop, we‚Äôd go over common types of property records that are likely kept by your local, county, and state governments‚Äîincluding corporation filings that are useful for peeking behind pesky LLCs. We‚Äôll also point out a few common issues with this type of data (assessors and recorders usually don‚Äôt share data!), pose general solutions to them (both with and without knowledge of coding languages), and walk through a sample scraper.</p>

                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>With the decennial census approaching, the Census Reporter team is thinking again about making tools to help journalists use Census data. We want to hear from journalists of all experience levels about what they want to do with Census data, especially decennial and American Community Survey. We don‚Äôt have funding right now, but we‚Äôre hoping that you all can help us paint an irresistible picture of a system that could be built, and use it to help build the support we need to make it happen. This will be a structured session designed to capture ‚Äústep,‚Äù ‚Äústretch,‚Äù and ‚Äúleap‚Äù improvements to the experience of finding and making sense of Census data.</p>

                <p>Numbers, numbers, numbers. Many journalists and journalism educators run from numbers and data because the words are scary without an understanding of real-world applications. Some, such as Loyola University, have had success making data come alive for their students by partnering with InvestigateTV on projects so students can relate to the numbers and see how data is used professionally. </p><p>Panelists will discuss their projects and give ideas for finding partners so you can do the same whether you are a student, an educator looking to enhance classroom learning or a professional eager for data help.</p>

                <p>The 2020 census has already begun. In mid-March, it ramps up with a blizzard of millions of mailed invitations to respond. The data and story possibilities will follow almost immediately and continue through at least 2022. Are you ready? Especially if you have not covered a census, this workshop will prepare you to make a plan, gather the data, understand it and turn it into compelling stories.</p><p>D'Vera Cohn and Paul Overberg have each been writing about the census since 1990. Dee, who covered census topics for The Washington Post before working for Pew Research, led five Poynter Institute 2020 census workshops for journalists over the past year. Paul led IRE-sponsored census training workshops and panels since 2000, and covered demographics for USA Today and The Wall Street Journal for more than 25 years.</p><p>This three-hour workshop will include:</p><p>* What numbers are coming when?<br>* Census-speak: Concepts and definitions to unlock the data and avoid newbie errors<br>* Geography: Understanding the "where" to find stories from neighborhood to national<br>* Seven stories any newsroom can do<br>* Examples of great 2010 census stories<br>* How census numbers can be used on every beat<br>* Making a newsroom plan: How to pick your spots and get outside help too</p>
