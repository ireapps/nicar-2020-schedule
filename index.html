    <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data. You‚Äôll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won‚Äôt have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited.

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots, and deal with any interactive elements this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

    <p>Yes, you can scrape data without using code -- in fact, all you need is Google Sheets! We'll be using Excel-type formulas (don't worry if you don't know what those are, either) to make simple scrapers that automatically pull data into Google Sheets. It‚Äôs the best way to get around clunky websites and unhelpful PIOs!</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners who want to start using data for their stories.</p>

    <p>This class will cover basic approaches for getting text out of PDF documents using online tool Cometdocs. IRE members have free subscriptions, which means no limit to the number of documents to convert. (No attendance is necessary, just email cometdocs@ire.org). For extracting tables, you'll play with Tabula in a step-by-step demo. In addition, you'll learn how to use a text editor and the import feature in Excel if neither of these approaches work. Lastly, if time allows, you'll see a demo of PDFtk, used for merging, splitting, and rotating a large batch of PDFs. Note that we will not cover Optical Character Recognition as it will be addressed in PDF2.</p><p><br>This session is good for: Non-coders without access to Adobe Acrobat Pro/DC and people who are unfamiliar with PDF-to-text tools or would like to learn how these tools can be used for extracting difficult text from images embedded in a PDF document.</p>

While this is important, this is not the only point in the process to consider the security of your interactions and information. In this training, we will overview the different types of encryption and how it comes into play when researching, writing, and communicating new stories. Attendees will walk away from this training understanding how to make informed decisions about the security of their tools and process from research to publication of a story.</p>

Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first-time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is affecting communities is vital, and this panel would show attendees how to do it. </p><p>This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project. We'll discuss data they should be requesting from their local agencies for quick turn stories or to find trends, including from housing courts, public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data-driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

    <p>Once the exclusive domain of scientists, engineers and HAM radio operators, a new generation of cheap hardware and open source software have cracked open the radio spectrum for hackers, hobbyists ‚Äî and journalists ‚Äî to explore. Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it‚Äôs time you started looking for them. We'll give an overview of how this all works, and walk you through the tools you can use to start poking around the radio spectrum. We‚Äôll also look at some interesting examples of how the radio spectrum has been used in reporting the news.</p>

But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data?

    <p>You‚Äôve learned how to use formulas and make pivot tables in Excel or maybe you've dabbled in a SQL program or R, but too often when you sit down in front of your own data, you find yourself staring at the computer screen, unsure how to proceed. </p><p>This session will give you a framework for a process you can follow with every new dataset you work with and set you up with some best practices that will make you more efficient and less likely to make a mistake, regardless of what tool you are using for your analysis. </p><p>At the heart of this framework is the idea that you are ‚Äúinterviewing‚Äù data in much the same way you would a human source. Many of the same steps you take in preparing for and conducting a human interview can be applied to your data work. Beyond that, the framework will help you navigate common issues with data that you need to find and deal with before you even start your analysis.</p>

    <p>In recent years, a handful of news organizations have published diversity reports to educate people in the industry about their challenges with diversity and to indicate that they are taking newsroom diversity seriously. This has also led to conversations about the effectiveness of diversity reports, what they should cover and how we can convince management to publish more revelatory indicators of diversity.</p><p>This will be a working session around all these questions. We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Satellite imagery has become easier to obtain, process and analyze, and journalists have increasingly turned to pictures from space to show burned land, eroding coastline and storm-ravaged landscapes. But there‚Äôs data in those pixels that journalists might not have considered that can be used to tell stories about the world around them ‚Äî ethnic cleansing, tribal clashes, the health of forests, pollution and more. </p><p>We turn to a panel of leading geospatial experts to explain how we could use remote sensing methods and tools like Google Earth Engine to lend authority to stories that otherwise might rely on anecdotes or worse yet, never get told at all.</p>

Graph databases are incredibly powerful for finding connections and patterns within our databases that would be difficult if not impossible to spot using traditional software. </p><p>This session will provide a hands-on introduction to graph database Neo4j, showing examples of its use for investigative journalism including the Panama Papers, and teach you how to build your own graph database, importing public datasets to see at a glance the networks involved.</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners to graph databases.</p>

    <p>Visualization is often taught as a set of rules that are set in stone ‚Äî "pie charts are dumb!", "make all your graphs start at 0!", "increase data-ink ratio!" ‚Äî but what if those rules have shaky foundations, being based just on the very personal aesthetic preferences of a handful of influential authors? This talk suggests that visualization is more similar to writing that we think: It's constrained by the limitations of the human brain but, beyond that, it's as flexible as written language, if not more. Instead of thinking of rules, then, visualization designers should learn how to make justified and informed decisions instead.</p>

    <p>‚ÄúWho owns what‚Äù is a classic reporting problem with a broad range of applications, whether you‚Äôre breaking news or during investigative work. In this workshop, we‚Äôd go over common types of property records that are likely kept by your local, county, and state governments‚Äîincluding corporation filings that are useful for peeking behind pesky LLCs. We‚Äôll also point out a few common issues with this type of data (assessors and recorders usually don‚Äôt share data!), pose general solutions to them (both with and without knowledge of coding languages), and walk through a sample scraper.</p>

    <p>Numbers, numbers, numbers. Many journalists and journalism educators run from numbers and data because the words are scary without an understanding of real-world applications. Some, such as Loyola University, have had success making data come alive for their students by partnering with InvestigateTV on projects so students can relate to the numbers and see how data is used professionally. </p><p>Panelists will discuss their projects and give ideas for finding partners so you can do the same whether you are a student, an educator looking to enhance classroom learning or a professional eager for data help.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>By using public records from an actual investigation, we will teach people how to think through turning their reams and reams of paper records into structured data. We want reporters to read through the documents and actively think about what information they need, how they can structure the data, and how they would need to fact-check data entry. We want attendees to leave feeling ready and willing to do heavy-hitting data investigations in their own newsrooms.</p>

    <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots, and deal with any interactive elements this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

    <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Census 2020 has already begun, and it's already creating data ‚Äî and stories. This session, anchored to the timeline of the coming year, will get you up to speed: key dates, lingo and what stories are possible when. We'll also offer a compendium of Census 2010 stories and local data like 2010 response and undercount rates. You'll also get a clear explanation of the unprecedented plan to add statistical noise to most Census 2020 results, and how that will affect your stories. Also: Late updates on the plan to use the census to bootstrap a controversial new data set: a count of citizens and non-citizens in every neighborhood.</p>

    <p>Many factors come into play when considering the security of a story. The most notable is the security around conversations with sources. While this is important, this is not the only point in the process to consider the security of your interactions and information. In this training, we will overview the different types of encryption and how it comes into play when researching, writing, and communicating new stories. Attendees will walk away from this training understanding how to make informed decisions about the security of their tools and process from research to publication of a story.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well ‚Äî or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first-time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is affecting communities is vital, and this panel would show attendees how to do it. </p><p>This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project. We'll discuss data they should be requesting from their local agencies for quick turn stories or to find trends, including from housing courts, public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data-driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

    <p>Once the exclusive domain of scientists, engineers and HAM radio operators, a new generation of cheap hardware and open source software have cracked open the radio spectrum for hackers, hobbyists ‚Äî and journalists ‚Äî to explore. Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it‚Äôs time you started looking for them. We'll give an overview of how this all works, and walk you through the tools you can use to start poking around the radio spectrum. We‚Äôll also look at some interesting examples of how the radio spectrum has been used in reporting the news.</p>

    <p>Python has been considered the go-to for scraping websites. But did you know it's really easy to do in R? Using the R library rvest, and a tool called "Selector Gadget" that lets you select elements by clicking, I hacked my way into scraping after multiple attempts in learning scraping the traditional way (BeautifulSoup and Inspect element). One of the advantages of R is that you can do everything in one environment, so why not include scraping into your R workflow?  </p><p>This session is good for: R users looking for another tool or coding beginners struggling to learn scraping in Python.</p>

    <p>We all love making political graphics, and election night can be a fun exercise in showing off our data graphics prowess. But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data? Is there any way to contextualize our graphics so we stop explaining WHO has power, but instead focus on HOW that power is used FOR or AGAINST who?</p><p>In the lead-up to 2020, let‚Äôs thoughtfully discuss why we do election results graphics and how can we make it better so that we can move beyond the ‚Äúhorserace‚Äù aspect of data journalism.</p>

    <p>In this hands-on session, you will learn the ins and outs of working with APIs, a flexible way for computers to communicate and share data. We'll cover working with public APIs as well as using APIs protected behind keys and other authentication methods. After this session you'll have the tools to dig deeper into your city's open data portal, scrape "unscrapeable" websites, convert addresses to coordinates, send texts or emails on command, grab data from Twitter, or even handle payments!</p><p>This session is good for: Everyone. We'll be working with tools non-coders can appreciate, but also wrangling the Python code that can take us to the next level.</p>

    <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Data journalism encompasses many different kinds of work, whether you work full time with data, manage a data team, use data to cover a beat, or use data visualization and interactivity to tell visual stories. It's not always clear what professional options may be available, or how you might go about growing into new opportunities. </p><p>In this session, we'll hear from a newspaper reporter whose focus on data eventually took them into academia, a designer/developer/journalist who ended up moving into leadership to help bring together her newsroom's visual storytelling departments, as well as a veteran TV journalist who forged her own path when there wasn't a data job in the newsroom.</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>In recent years, a handful of news organizations have published diversity reports to educate people in the industry about their challenges with diversity and to indicate that they are taking newsroom diversity seriously. This has also led to conversations about the effectiveness of diversity reports, what they should cover and how we can convince management to publish more revelatory indicators of diversity.</p><p>This will be a working session around all these questions. We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.</p>

    <p>Satellite imagery has become easier to obtain, process and analyze, and journalists have increasingly turned to pictures from space to show burned land, eroding coastline and storm-ravaged landscapes. But there‚Äôs data in those pixels that journalists might not have considered that can be used to tell stories about the world around them ‚Äî ethnic cleansing, tribal clashes, the health of forests, pollution and more. </p><p>We turn to a panel of leading geospatial experts to explain how we could use remote sensing methods and tools like Google Earth Engine to lend authority to stories that otherwise might rely on anecdotes or worse yet, never get told at all.</p>

    <p>Voter file data can be an important reporting tool, but the data is so fragmented it's difficult to find, standardize and aggregate. In addition, readers are often shocked that this level of data is available. We will discuss practical tips for when voter data is useful, how to find and process it, what it can't do, and how to report accurately and responsibly on voter data breaches, and leave lots of time for voter data questions!</p>

    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Visualization is often taught as a set of rules that are set in stone ‚Äî "pie charts are dumb!", "make all your graphs start at 0!", "increase data-ink ratio!" ‚Äî but what if those rules have shaky foundations, being based just on the very personal aesthetic preferences of a handful of influential authors? This talk suggests that visualization is more similar to writing that we think: It's constrained by the limitations of the human brain but, beyond that, it's as flexible as written language, if not more. Instead of thinking of rules, then, visualization designers should learn how to make justified and informed decisions instead.</p>

    <p>‚ÄúWho owns what‚Äù is a classic reporting problem with a broad range of applications, whether you‚Äôre breaking news or during investigative work. In this workshop, we‚Äôd go over common types of property records that are likely kept by your local, county, and state governments‚Äîincluding corporation filings that are useful for peeking behind pesky LLCs. We‚Äôll also point out a few common issues with this type of data (assessors and recorders usually don‚Äôt share data!), pose general solutions to them (both with and without knowledge of coding languages), and walk through a sample scraper.</p>

    <p>With the decennial census approaching, the Census Reporter team is thinking again about making tools to help journalists use Census data. We want to hear from journalists of all experience levels about what they want to do with Census data, especially decennial and American Community Survey. We don‚Äôt have funding right now, but we‚Äôre hoping that you all can help us paint an irresistible picture of a system that could be built, and use it to help build the support we need to make it happen. This will be a structured session designed to capture ‚Äústep,‚Äù ‚Äústretch,‚Äù and ‚Äúleap‚Äù improvements to the experience of finding and making sense of Census data.</p>
