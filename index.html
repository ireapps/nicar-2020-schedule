                  <p>Skill level: Beginner</p><p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We’ll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We’ll do some “drills” introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of “scrimmage,” fixing up some real-life data. You’ll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won’t have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use pivot tables.<br></p>

                  <p>Fuzzy matching is a process for linking up names that are similar but not quite the same. It has become an increasingly important part of data-led investigations as a way to identify connections between public figures, key people and companies that are relevant to a story. This class will cover how fuzzy matching typically fits into the investigative process, with some story examples. Max Harlow, who developed the CSV Match command line tool, will show you how to run some of the different types of fuzzy matching on some real datasets, including the pros and cons of each.</p>

                  <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots, and deal with any interactive elements this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data "pipeline". This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for people with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you can scrape data without using code -- in fact, all you need is Google Sheets! We'll be using Excel-type formulas (don't worry if you don't know what those are, either) to make simple scrapers that automatically pull data into Google Sheets. It’s the best way to get around clunky websites and unhelpful PIOs!</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners who want to start using data for their stories.</p>

                  <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required. Farsight introduced a grant program for investigative reporters earlier this year.  We delivered similar training at CAR 2019 in Newport Beach and it was well-received. We would like to come back to share our latest knowledge and hands-on training.</p>

And how to explain "global privacy budget" and "differential privacy" to editors. We can also suggest ways to use ACS data in 2020 to foreshadow some of what the new census data will show in 2021.</p><p>More importantly, we would compile and share hard-to-find data that can ground local coverage: local response rates from the 2000 and 2010 censuses; neighborhood-level likelihood-to-respond scores; Census 2010 undercounts for states; major cities and counties; and age and racial groups; and what Census 2010 totals would have looked like with the distortion that's planned for Census 2020.</p>

                  <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well -- or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

                  <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is effecting communities is vital and this panel would show attendees how to do it. This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project including data they should be requesting from their local agencies right now for quick turn stories or to find trends. This includes what to ask housing courts, best data from public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

                  <p>Python has been considered the go-to for scraping websites. But did you know it's really easy to do in R? Using the R library rvest, a tool called "Selector Gadget" that lets you select elements by clicking, I hacked my way into scraping after multiple attempts in learning scraping the traditional way: BeautifulSoup and Inspect element. One of the advantages of R is that you can do everything in one environment, why not include scraping into your R workflow? I can show how to select elements from a website, scrape the the data and prepare it for analysis. I can also share some tips on how to not be seen as a robot and therefore be blocked by the website you're trying to scrape. This session would be good for R users looking for another tool or coding beginners struggling to learn scraping in Python.</p>

But, is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there’s so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data? Is there any way to contextualize our graphics so we stop explaining WHO has power, but instead focus on HOW that power is used FOR or AGAINST who?</p><p>In the lead-up to 2020, let’s thoughtfully discuss why we do election results graphics and how can we make it better so that we can move beyond the “horserace” aspect of data journalism.</p>

This session will give you a framework for a process you can follow with every new dataset you work with and set you up with some best practices that will make you more efficient and less likely to make a mistake -- regardless of what tool you are using for your analysis. At the heart of this framework is the idea that you are “interviewing” data in much the same way you would a human source. Many of the same steps you take in preparing for and conducting a human interview can be applied to your data work. Beyond that, the framework will help you navigate common issues with data that you need to find and deal with before you even start your analysis.<br></p>

                  <p>Every online interaction begins with a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of the Internet. As a result, there are digital footprints left behind in the DNS. With the demise of Whois, investigative reporters are looking for new tools to uncover these footprints. Learn how to use DNSDB Scout, a tool to query DNSDB, a historical passive Domain Name System (DNS) database, to discover previously unknown online connections and gain new information to advance your  ongoing and breaking news investigations. </p><p>Basic knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) is helpful, but not required. Farsight introduced a grant program for investigative reporters earlier this year.  We delivered similar training at CAR 2019 in Newport Beach and it was well-received. We would like to come back to share our latest knowledge and hands-on training.</p>

                  <p>There are plenty of tutorials and training sessions to help a new coder get started. And there are plenty of awards lists and conference sessions that will wow you with some amazing advanced work. But once you've done the tutorials and experimented with what you've learned in the hands-on sessions, you'll likely find yourself stuck -- you're no longer a beginner, but you're also not an expert, and you don’t really understand how to take the next step on that journey. You've hit a classic learning plateau, and there aren't many resources to help you break through and take your coding to the next level. In this session, we'll discuss key concepts that bridge the gap between beginner and expert coder and present strategies for leveling-up -- while still meeting your deadlines.</p>

                  <p>Satellite imagery has become easier to obtain, process and analyze, and journalists have increasingly turned to pictures from space to show burned land, eroding coastline and storm-ravaged landscapes. But there’s data in those pixels that journalists might not have considered that can be used to tell stories about the world around them --- ethnic cleansing, tribal clashes, the health of forests, pollution and more. We turn to a panel of leading geospatial experts to explain how we could use remote sensing methods and tools like Google Earth Engine to lend authority to stories that otherwise might rely on anecdotes or worse yet, never get told at all.</p>

                  <p>Journalists will walk way from our session understanding how to securely lock-down their social media profiles. This hands-on cybersecurity training provides the practical tools to add an extra layer of security for anyone using social media for their online investigations. From war reporters to business reporters — and anyone worried about the potential of doxxing — our session will teach journalists to use VPNs, multifactor authentication and simple social engineering to protect their identities while operating online, and in the process, protect the identities of their families and friends.</p>

                  <p>Local investigations present unique opportunities and challenges for journalists working with data. Local data is often thought of as sparse since smaller localities do not always have the resources necessary to document and open source their information. Similarly, small newsrooms don’t always have the bandwidth to sponsor long-term and expensive data-collection initiatives. However, working with data at the local level also presents advantages. Local reporters have the opportunity to grow intimately familiar with the various types of information aggregated in their jurisdictions. Also working at a smaller scale can make a greater number of investigations possible. This talk will shed light on how to find data for local investigations, and take advantage of the seemingly limited resource environment that local reporters draw from when seeking aggregate information for their stories.</p>

                  <p>I’ve spent the past few years filing data and documentation requests with police and sheriff’s departments all over the country. I’ve obtained extensive documentation on roughly 20 of the most commonly-used CAD, Records Management and Case Management systems, and several other systems custom-made for some of the nations’s largest police departments. We plan on publishing this documentation at the end of the year, after my stories run, probably on our GitHub, our website, and through IRE. I’d like to do a session walking people through these different types of databases, what they are used for (911, patrol, detectives, administration, etc.), how they work (and don’t work!) together, how to use the documentation to make requests for data that hasn’t been released before, pitfalls to avoid, and a bunch of other stuff I’ve learned along the way (sometimes the hard way).<br></p>

In this workshop, we’d go over common types of property records that are likely kept by your local, county, and state governments—including corporation filings that are useful for peeking behind pesky LLCs. We’ll also point out a few common issues with this type of data (assessors and recorders usually don’t share data!), pose general solutions to them (both with and without knowledge of coding languages), and walk through a sample scraper.<br></p>

                  <p>It's always been incredibly hard to make data findings come to life on radio. Radio producers appreciate the role of data in investigative findings, but often producers and data reporters have to come up with creative and innovative solutions. This session will take the audience through some successful award-winning examples and unpack the different kinds of datasets that can lend themselves to the different strategies (whether it is programmatic data sonification or using a live church choir). This is a particularly important session with the rise of investigative radio shows and podcasts and data reporters still working to come up with new ideas. A lot of progress has been made, but we haven't had recent NICAR panels to update on the progress. I am extremely happy to lead this session as one of my pieces of data sonfication won a National Edward Murrow award in 2019.</p>
