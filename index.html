        <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data.

        <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots and deal with any interactive elements, this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

        <p>Open data provides unique insights into crime, policing and criminal justice activity within a city and creates a new opportunity to tell complex, interactive stories in dashboard format. These data are a terrific source for identifying changing crime trends, evaluating policy effectiveness, and providing transparency to the public on issues of critical importance. In this presentation Jeff Asher of AH Datalytics will go over the different types of available data throughout the criminal justice spectrum and give examples of how these data can be used both in terms of analyzing crime trends as well as building dashboards to better illustrate a story.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>This class will cover basic approaches for getting text out of PDF documents using online tool Cometdocs. IRE members have free subscriptions, which means no limit to the number of documents to convert. (No attendance is necessary, just email cometdocs@ire.org). For extracting tables, you'll play with Tabula in a step-by-step demo. In addition, you'll learn how to use a text editor and the import feature in Excel if neither of these approaches work. Lastly, if time allows, you'll see a demo of PDFtk, used for merging, splitting, and rotating a large batch of PDFs. Note that we will not cover Optical Character Recognition as it will be addressed in PDF2.</p><p><br>This session is good for: Non-coders without access to Adobe Acrobat Pro/DC and people who are unfamiliar with PDF-to-text tools or would like to learn how these tools can be used for extracting difficult text from images embedded in a PDF document.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well ‚Äî or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first-time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is affecting communities is vital, and this panel would show attendees how to do it. </p><p>This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project. We'll discuss data they should be requesting from their local agencies for quick turn stories or to find trends, including from housing courts, public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data-driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it‚Äôs time you started looking for them. We'll give an overview of how this all works, and walk you through the tools you can use to start poking around the radio spectrum.

        <p>Python has been considered the go-to for web-scraping for many, but did you know web scraping can be easy in R too? This session walks through how to scrape data from the web with R library Rvest. If you had trouble copying a table from a webpage and pasting it in an Excel spreadsheet, or if you want to access data and files buried behind hyperlinks without clicking each one of the links, this is the session for you.</p><p>This session would be the best for people who has basic knowledge of R but haven't scraped the web. Knowledge of HTML/CSS is helpful but not required.</p>

        <p>We all love making political graphics, and election night can be a fun exercise in showing off our data graphics prowess. But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data? Is there any way to contextualize our graphics so we stop explaining WHO has power, but instead focus on HOW that power is used FOR or AGAINST who?</p><p>In the lead-up to 2020, let‚Äôs thoughtfully discuss why we do election results graphics and how can we make it better so that we can move beyond the ‚Äúhorserace‚Äù aspect of data journalism.</p>

        <p>As wildfires have become more frequent and more intense, newsrooms have opportunities to raise the bar of their reporting by bringing data into their coverage of these disasters. Over the past year, media outlets have increasingly incorporated data into their wildfire coverage, whether to track fires while they happen, provide new context or by digging into data about contributing factors and fallout. We will highlight some of the best examples, review how projects we worked on came together, discuss how data-driven wildfire reporting could be improved in the future and go through sources and ideas that newsrooms can put into use for their own wildfire coverage.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>In recent years, a handful of news organizations have published diversity reports to educate people in the industry about their challenges with diversity and to indicate that they are taking newsroom diversity seriously. This has also led to conversations about the effectiveness of diversity reports, what they should cover and how we can convince management to publish more revelatory indicators of diversity.</p><p>This will be a working session around all these questions. We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.</p>

        <p>A discussion between three researchers/scientists and a journo, exploring how the press can best work with academic communities, both as a source of wisdom and knowledge and also data. What are each side‚Äôs complementary interests, and why do they sometimes collide? How do scientists and journos use data, and how those uses sometimes differ? And why journos often focus on outliers, the statistical tails, and why scientists usually don‚Äôt.</p>

        <p>The promise of the Freedom of Information Act often falls short of expectations, and the process can be long and drawn-out. For a beat reporter, FOIA can be particularly daunting. This panel will provide concrete strategies for conceptualizing, drafting, filing and employing strategies to get records on deadline. It also will offer a realistic guide to filing and managing your FOIA requests, how to use FOIA when you're swamped or busy, how to strategize to get materials more quickly, and where to look for already-FOIA'd information that might be in the public domain.</p>

        <p>As data journalists, we're used to using relational databases ‚Äî data organised in rows and columns such as a spreadsheet or SQL ‚Äî to do our analysis and find stories. Graph databases are incredibly powerful for finding connections and patterns within our databases that would be difficult if not impossible to spot using traditional software. </p><p>This session will provide a hands-on introduction to graph database Neo4j, showing examples of its use for investigative journalism including the Panama Papers, and teach you how to build your own graph database, importing public datasets to see at a glance the networks involved.</p><p>This session is good for: Beginners to graph databases.</p>

        <p>Visualization is often taught as a set of rules that are set in stone ‚Äî "pie charts are dumb!", "make all your graphs start at 0!", "increase data-ink ratio!" ‚Äî but what if those rules have shaky foundations, being based just on the very personal aesthetic preferences of a handful of influential authors? This talk suggests that visualization is more similar to writing that we think: It's constrained by the limitations of the human brain but, beyond that, it's as flexible as written language, if not more.

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Local investigations present unique opportunities and challenges for journalists working with data. Local data is often thought of as sparse since smaller localities do not always have the resources necessary to document and open source their information. Similarly, small newsrooms don‚Äôt always have the bandwidth to sponsor long-term and expensive data-collection initiatives. </p><p>However, working with data at the local level also presents advantages. Local reporters have the opportunity to grow intimately familiar with the various types of information aggregated in their jurisdictions. Also working at a smaller scale can make a greater number of investigations possible. </p><p>This talk will shed light on how to find data for local investigations, and take advantage of the seemingly limited resource environment that local reporters draw from when seeking aggregate information for their stories.</p>

        <p>Bring your data to life with elegant and intelligent visualizations with the D3 JavaScript library. We'll start with some Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) basics and learn what makes the D3 library so powerful, then use real-world datasets to build your first D3 chart. We will build on D3 basics by exploring more complex chart forms, covering functions for fetching and manipulating data, and introducing transitions and interaction. We will write working code together, break down how some of our favorite examples of D3 charts work and practice reading documentation so you can gain expertise on your own.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: Attendees should have some knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Previous D3 experience is not required.</p>

In this panel we'll talk about our myriad experiences getting these tricky troves to bear fruit for stories, as well as tips for finding and using them.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>With the decennial census approaching, the Census Reporter team is thinking again about making tools to help journalists use Census data. We want to hear from journalists of all experience levels about what they want to do with Census data, especially decennial and American Community Survey. We don‚Äôt have funding right now, but we‚Äôre hoping that you all can help us paint an irresistible picture of a system that could be built, and use it to help build the support we need to make it happen. This will be a structured session designed to capture ‚Äústep,‚Äù ‚Äústretch,‚Äù and ‚Äúleap‚Äù improvements to the experience of finding and making sense of Census data.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Join us to discuss how automation is changing newsrooms and journalism roles. Some newsrooms are vanguards for automating parts of news production, from information gathering and storytelling to data-driven tools that help journalists to do their jobs. Our panelists will share insights about how the industry has adopted automation techniques. Where are these tools heading next? What could other newsrooms learn from their experience? Also, what kind of new skills do journalists need when newsrooms embrace this kind of technology?</p>

        <p>If you've found yourself struggling in a spreadsheet, thinking that whatever you were trying to achieve seemed harder than it should've been, then this is the class for you. We‚Äôll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We‚Äôll do some ‚Äúdrills‚Äù introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of ‚Äúscrimmage,‚Äù fixing up some real-life data. You‚Äôll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won‚Äôt have time for.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use pivot tables.</p>

        <p>If you want to scrape websites, crawl them, extract their data, take screenshots and deal with any interactive elements, this class will show you how. A great way to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript is to scrape them using JavaScript. Cypress and Puppeteer are great tools to use; Puppeteer is a Node project which provides an API to control the Chrome browser, and Cypress is normally used for site testing. We'll show you how these tools can be used to gather data for your stories, and how they fit into a newsroom data pipeline. This session will provide demos of how to scrape with both.</p><p>This session is good for: People with intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and Node.</p>

We will discuss our projects and give ideas for finding partners so you can do the same whether you are an educator looking to enhance classroom learning, a student who wants to intern or work on a newsroom data project, or a professional eager for data help from a nearby university.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Alex Garcia, Ellis Simani, Ben Welsh and Aaron Williams teach you how to rapidly prototype a complex data visualization with JavaScript, D3.js and an interactive Observable notebook.</p><p>This three-hour, hands-on course will show you how journalists are putting Observable‚Äôs powerful potential to work. Using nothing but your web browser, you will sketch, refine and publish an interactive graphic like one that appeared in The New York Times. Along the way, you‚Äôll see how Observable‚Äôs groundbreaking approach to coding can help you be more creative, ambitious and efficient.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: If you‚Äôve used JavaScript once or twice, have a good attitude and know how to take a few code crashes in stride, you are qualified for this class. If you‚Äôre suspicious and think we might be Internet hipsters, we welcome the challenge of winning you over. This stuff is cool.</p>

        <p>Open data provides unique insights into crime, policing and criminal justice activity within a city and creates a new opportunity to tell complex, interactive stories in dashboard format. These data are a terrific source for identifying changing crime trends, evaluating policy effectiveness, and providing transparency to the public on issues of critical importance. In this presentation Jeff Asher of AH Datalytics will go over the different types of available data throughout the criminal justice spectrum and give examples of how these data can be used both in terms of analyzing crime trends as well as building dashboards to better illustrate a story.</p>

        <p>This class will cover basic approaches for getting text out of PDF documents using online tool Cometdocs. IRE members have free subscriptions, which means no limit to the number of documents to convert. (No attendance is necessary, just email cometdocs@ire.org). For extracting tables, you'll play with Tabula in a step-by-step demo. In addition, you'll learn how to use a text editor and the import feature in Excel if neither of these approaches work. Lastly, if time allows, you'll see a demo of PDFtk, used for merging, splitting, and rotating a large batch of PDFs. Note that we will not cover Optical Character Recognition as it will be addressed in PDF2.</p><p><br>This session is good for: Non-coders without access to Adobe Acrobat Pro/DC and people who are unfamiliar with PDF-to-text tools or would like to learn how these tools can be used for extracting difficult text from images embedded in a PDF document.</p>

        <p>Many factors come into play when considering the security of a story. The most notable is the security around conversations with sources. While this is important, this is not the only point in the process to consider the security of your interactions and information. In this training, we will overview the different types of encryption and how it comes into play when researching, writing, and communicating new stories. Attendees will walk away from this training understanding how to make informed decisions about the security of their tools and process from research to publication of a story.</p>

        <p>Every journalist has faced down the dreaded install of a new tool that doesn't go well ‚Äî or even go at all. Maybe it's led to inscrutable Python error messages that no one can help you diagnose. Perhaps you work for an organization that won't (or can't) grant admin rights on company hardware. Or it could be that you're trying to teach command-line tools to a bunch of college students without having them brick their machines. </p><p>To get around some of these pitfalls, new tools/platforms like Binder, RStudio Cloud and others have come online, offering to serve up Python and R like the second coming of the Google Suite. But which services work best? What are the limits? What do they cost, if anything? How much work do you have to put in to get them functioning properly?</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Stories about redlining and the inequities among home loan recipients from big banks have dominated housing coverage in recent years. But homeownership is just one part of the affordable housing conversation that needs coverage. Public housing authorities, federal disinvestment in public housing/the Section 8 program, county/city first-time homeowner loan programs, evictions at housing courts, slumlord landlords, tenant protection ordinances, and localizing coverage of how Secretary Ben Carson's HUD is affecting communities is vital, and this panel would show attendees how to do it. </p><p>This workshop is for people interested in amping up housing coverage as a side beat, their main beat or a one-time project. We'll discuss data they should be requesting from their local agencies for quick turn stories or to find trends, including from housing courts, public housing authorities and more. This workshop goes beyond the redlining projects to help journalists find data-driven affordable housing stories no matter where they are.</p>

Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it‚Äôs time you started looking for them. We'll give an overview of how this all works, and walk you through the tools you can use to start poking around the radio spectrum. We‚Äôll also look at some interesting examples of how the radio spectrum has been used in reporting the news.</p>

        <p>We all love making political graphics, and election night can be a fun exercise in showing off our data graphics prowess. But is there any point to these graphics beyond just showing election results, especially since there‚Äôs so many news outlets doing the same iterations of the exact same data? Is there any way to contextualize our graphics so we stop explaining WHO has power, but instead focus on HOW that power is used FOR or AGAINST who?</p><p>In the lead-up to 2020, let‚Äôs thoughtfully discuss why we do election results graphics and how can we make it better so that we can move beyond the ‚Äúhorserace‚Äù aspect of data journalism.</p>

        <p>As wildfires have become more frequent and more intense, newsrooms have opportunities to raise the bar of their reporting by bringing data into their coverage of these disasters. Over the past year, media outlets have increasingly incorporated data into their wildfire coverage, whether to track fires while they happen, provide new context or by digging into data about contributing factors and fallout. We will highlight some of the best examples, review how projects we worked on came together, discuss how data-driven wildfire reporting could be improved in the future and go through sources and ideas that newsrooms can put into use for their own wildfire coverage.</p>

        <p>Data journalism encompasses many different kinds of work, whether you work full time with data, manage a data team, use data to cover a beat, or use data visualization and interactivity to tell visual stories. It's not always clear what professional options may be available, or how you might go about growing into new opportunities. </p><p>In this session, we'll hear from a newspaper reporter whose focus on data eventually took them into academia, a designer/developer/journalist who ended up moving into leadership to help bring together her newsroom's visual storytelling departments, as well as a veteran TV journalist who forged her own path when there wasn't a data job in the newsroom.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>In recent years, a handful of news organizations have published diversity reports to educate people in the industry about their challenges with diversity and to indicate that they are taking newsroom diversity seriously. This has also led to conversations about the effectiveness of diversity reports, what they should cover and how we can convince management to publish more revelatory indicators of diversity.</p><p>This will be a working session around all these questions. We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.</p>

But there‚Äôs data in those pixels that journalists might not have considered that can be used to tell stories about the world around them ‚Äî ethnic cleansing, tribal clashes, the health of forests, pollution and more. </p><p>We turn to a panel of leading geospatial experts to explain how we could use remote sensing methods and tools like Google Earth Engine to lend authority to stories that otherwise might rely on anecdotes or worse yet, never get told at all.</p>

        <p>Satellites, planes, drones ‚Äî thanks to these and other planetary-sensors, we know more about our earth, its oceans, landscapes and cityscapes than ever before. With heaps of new data and tools at our disposal, journalists are among the many people accessing this wellspring of source data and using it to show changes at global and local scales at an ever-increasing rate, from the disappearing polar ice caps to monitoring local port shipments.</p><p>This workshop will provide an introduction to practical geographic journalism through concrete case studies. It will then offer tools and skills that can help you start infusing earth imagery into your stories. You will leave this workshop with a new way of thinking about earth imagery and how to use it.</p><p>Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites but it would be helpful to have some experience with QGIS, bash (imagemagick, ffmpeg, gdal), and Photoshop.</p>

        <p>A discussion between three researchers/scientists and a journo, exploring how the press can best work with academic communities, both as a source of wisdom and knowledge and also data. What are each side‚Äôs complementary interests, and why do they sometimes collide? How do scientists and journos use data, and how those uses sometimes differ? And why journos often focus on outliers, the statistical tails, and why scientists usually don‚Äôt.</p>

        <p>The promise of the Freedom of Information Act often falls short of expectations, and the process can be long and drawn-out. For a beat reporter, FOIA can be particularly daunting. This panel will provide concrete strategies for conceptualizing, drafting, filing and employing strategies to get records on deadline. It also will offer a realistic guide to filing and managing your FOIA requests, how to use FOIA when you're swamped or busy, how to strategize to get materials more quickly, and where to look for already-FOIA'd information that might be in the public domain.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Visualization is often taught as a set of rules that are set in stone ‚Äî "pie charts are dumb!", "make all your graphs start at 0!", "increase data-ink ratio!" ‚Äî but what if those rules have shaky foundations, being based just on the very personal aesthetic preferences of a handful of influential authors? This talk suggests that visualization is more similar to writing that we think: It's constrained by the limitations of the human brain but, beyond that, it's as flexible as written language, if not more. Instead of thinking of rules, then, visualization designers should learn how to make justified and informed decisions instead.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Local investigations present unique opportunities and challenges for journalists working with data. Local data is often thought of as sparse since smaller localities do not always have the resources necessary to document and open source their information. Similarly, small newsrooms don‚Äôt always have the bandwidth to sponsor long-term and expensive data-collection initiatives. </p><p>However, working with data at the local level also presents advantages. Local reporters have the opportunity to grow intimately familiar with the various types of information aggregated in their jurisdictions. Also working at a smaller scale can make a greater number of investigations possible. </p><p>This talk will shed light on how to find data for local investigations, and take advantage of the seemingly limited resource environment that local reporters draw from when seeking aggregate information for their stories.</p>

        <p>Bring your data to life with elegant and intelligent visualizations with the D3 JavaScript library. We'll start with some Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) basics and learn what makes the D3 library so powerful, then use real-world datasets to build your first D3 chart. We will build on D3 basics by exploring more complex chart forms, covering functions for fetching and manipulating data, and introducing transitions and interaction. We will write working code together, break down how some of our favorite examples of D3 charts work and practice reading documentation so you can gain expertise on your own.</p><p>Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. </p><p>Workshop prerequisites: Attendees should have some knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Previous D3 experience is not required.</p>

        <p>Whether you're on a beat, on an investigative team or at a research desk, court records are a resource you can't ignore. They are as valuable as they are difficult to access and analyze en masse. In this panel we'll talk about our myriad experiences getting these tricky troves to bear fruit for stories, as well as tips for finding and using them.</p>

        <p>With the decennial census approaching, the Census Reporter team is thinking again about making tools to help journalists use Census data. We want to hear from journalists of all experience levels about what they want to do with Census data, especially decennial and American Community Survey. We don‚Äôt have funding right now, but we‚Äôre hoping that you all can help us paint an irresistible picture of a system that could be built, and use it to help build the support we need to make it happen. This will be a structured session designed to capture ‚Äústep,‚Äù ‚Äústretch,‚Äù and ‚Äúleap‚Äù improvements to the experience of finding and making sense of Census data.</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
    
        <p>Join us to discuss how automation is changing newsrooms and journalism roles. Some newsrooms are vanguards for automating parts of news production, from information gathering and storytelling to data-driven tools that help journalists to do their jobs. Our panelists will share insights about how the industry has adopted automation techniques. Where are these tools heading next? What could other newsrooms learn from their experience? Also, what kind of new skills do journalists need when newsrooms embrace this kind of technology?</p>
